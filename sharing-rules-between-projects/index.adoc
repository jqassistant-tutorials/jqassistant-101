// tag::lead[]
Create a plugin containing shared rules for using them in different projects.
// end::lead[]

NOTE: This tutorial is written for version 1.8.0 of jQAssistant.

== Overview

jQAssistant allows sharing rules (i.e. concepts, constraints and groups) for being used by different projects.
This way it is possible to...

- enforce coding standards and guidelines across organizations or teams by providing constraints
- provide re-usable concepts for widely used frameworks to ease the creation of project specific constraints

The common approach to share rules is by distributing them as a jQAssistant plugin.
For this tutorial two example constraints shall be made available:

maven:GroupId::
Verifies that the groupId of all Maven modules within a project complies to a specific pattern.

package:RootPackage::
Verifies that all Java classes of a project are located within a given root package.
As the name of the package is project specific the constraints expects a parameter to be passed at build time.

For convenience reasons the rules are bundled into groups to ease execution and evolution.

== Providing Rules As Plugin

=== The Plugin Structure

The standard approach of sharing rules is by distributing them as a jQAssistant plugin.
Therefore a JAR artifact is created using a https://maven.apache.org[Maven] project and the following `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
include::rules/pom.xml[indent=0]
----

The file mainly declares test dependencies that will be used later for verifying the rules.

jQAssistant expects a plugin descriptor `/META-INF/jqassistant-plugin.xml` as classpath resource.
It declares files containing rules that shall be shared:

[source,xml]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-plugin.xml
----
include::rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-plugin.xml[]
----

The referenced files are expected as classpath resources located in the folder `/META-INF/jqassistant-rules`.
This tutorial uses XML documents to declare the rules.
Thus the following folder structure is expected:

[source,raw]
----
META-INF/
├── jqassistant-plugin.xml
└── jqassistant-rules/
    ├── jqassistant-plugin.xmlpackage.xml
    ├── jqassistant-plugin.xmlmaven.xml
    └── my-organization.xml
----

NOTE: Asciidoc files are supported as well but take longer time to load at startup.
Therefore the recommended format is XML to not negatively affect the build process of other projects.

The next sections describe the shared rules in detail.

=== Maven Related Rules

The file `maven.xml` provides rules related to Apache Maven:

[source,xml]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/maven.xml
----
include::rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/maven.xml[]
----

maven:GroupId::
A constraint verifying that each Maven project uses a defined pattern for the `groupId`.

maven:Default::
A group that bundles selected constraints in the XML file.
This approach allows for easier execution by just referencing this group and allows adding or removing rules in the future without the need to change the setup of projects using this plugin.
There might be as well other groups including more or less rules, e.g. `maven:Strict` for more restrictive checks.

=== Package Related Rules

The file `package.xml` provides rules regarding the package structure of a project:

[source,xml]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/package.xml
----
include::rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/package.xml[]
----

package:RootPackage::
A constraint verifying that all Java types of a project are located within a defined root package.
The name of the latter is expected as parameter `rootPackage` which must be present during execution of jQAssistant (e.g. as Maven plugin).

package:Default::
A group with the same purpose as `maven:Default` described above.

Rules may be verified by tests.
The following code snippet shows an example for the constraint `package:RootPackage`:

[source,java]
.src/test/java/my/organization/rules/PackageTest.java
----
include::rules/src/test/java/my/organization/rules/PackageTest.java[tags=Test]
----

=== Grouping Rules For Execution

The file `my-organization.xml` contains defines a group:

[source,xml]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/my-organization.xml
----
include::rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/my-organization.xml[]
----

my-organization:Default::
This group bundles the groups `maven:Default` and `package:Default`.
Thus a project using the rules provided by this plugin only needs to declare this group for execution.

TIP: Bundling rules into different groups can be used for staged roll-out into projects.
New constraints at first can be included into a group `my-organization:Staging` and tested in selected projects (or using Maven profiles).
After validation they can be moved to `my-organization:Default` (or groups included there) and thus become mandatory for all projects.

== Using Shared Rules In A Maven Project

This section demonstrates how the set of shared rules may be activated in a Maven based project.
The latter defines its own set of specific rules.
These are bundled in the group `project:Default` which is declared in the file `jqassistant/index.adoc`

[source,asciidoc]
.jqassistant/index.adoc
....
include::project/jqassistant/index.adoc[]
....

The Maven build descriptor `pom.xml` contains the declaration for the jQAssistant plugin:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
include::project/pom.xml[tags=plugin,indent=0]
----

- The plugin containing the shared rules is declared as dependency.
- The configuration section selects the groups `my-organization:Default` and `project:Default` for execution.
- Furthermore a value for the parameter `rootPackage` required by the constraint `package:RootPackage` is defined.

The project can now be built as usual and all required rules will be executed:

[source,raw]
----
mvn install
----

== Using Shared Rules With The Command Line Utility

For using shared rules the plugin JAR file must be copied to the folder `plugins/` of the command line utility.

Furthermore a properties file must be created providing rule parameters, i.e. `rootPackage` required by the constraint `package:RootPackage`:

[source,properties]
.ruleParameters.properties
----
rootPackage=my.organization
----

Now the analysis can be executed using the following command:

[source,raw]
----
# Unix
jqassistant.sh analyze -groups my-organization:Default,project:Default -ruleParameters ruleParameters.properties

# Windows
jqassistant.cmd analyze -groups my-organization:Default,project:Default -ruleParameters ruleParameters.properties
----
