[role=group,includesConstraints="adr:*"]
== 001 - No deep linking between aggregates

=== Status: Proposed

=== Context

* Migration of the product catalog from relational to document-based database

=== Decision

* Document-based databases require modeling of aggregates
** Deep links between aggregates are not allowed

=== Consequences

* All entities must only be referenced from one aggregate root
* Existing deep linking between aggregates must be removed
