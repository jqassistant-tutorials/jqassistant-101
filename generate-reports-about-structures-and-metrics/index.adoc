// tag::lead[]
Generate HTML reports from Asciidoc documents including rules and embed results as tables, diagrams or CSV files.
// end::lead[]

NOTE: This tutorial is written for version 1.8.0 of jQAssistant.

== Overview

Rules (i.e. concepts and constraints) may be embedded into Asciidoc files.
jQAssistant executes these rules and renders the documents to HTML with embedded results.

By default the results are represented as tables but it is possible to specify different report types:

`<<component-diagrams,plantuml-component-diagram>>`::
  Nodes and relationships of the result are converted to a PlantUML component diagram and rendered to an SVG file.
`<<class-diagrams,plantuml-class-diagram>>`::
  Nodes representing Java packages, classes, fields or members and their connecting relations are converted
  to a PlantUML class diagram which is rendered to an SVG file.
`<<sequence-diagrams,plantuml-sequence-diagram>>`::
  Path structures of the result are converted to a PlantUML sequence diagrams which is rendered to an SVG file.

NOTE: For rendering https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] diagrams http://www.graphviz.org[Graphviz] needs to be installed and the `dot` executable available via the system path.

Furthermore a report type may be chosen for creating a file of a dedicated format which then will be shown as link:

`<<graphml,graphml>>`::
  Similar to the `plantuml-component-diagram` nodes and relationships are converted to a GraphML file.
  This may be viewed and explored using http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/[`yEd`].
`<<csv,csv>>`::
  Create a CSV file containing tabular data for further analysis in other tools.

TIP: Usually concepts are used for creating reports as they represent your chosen design & architecture language.

For this tutorial the following project structure is going to be used:

[source,raw]
----
your.project      <1>
your.project.a    <2>
your.project.b
your.project.c
----

<1> The root package of the project is `your.project`.
<2> A package located directly within the root package represents a `Module`.
The project consists of the modules `a`, `b` and `c` where `b` and `c` contain Java types depending on types located in `a`.

The structure and the metrics of this project shall be continuously reported within each build.

== Integrate jQAssistant Into The Build Process

The tutorial uses https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] for building the project.

jQAssistant is enabled by adding the plugin to the build/plugins section of the file `pom.xml`.

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=plugin,indent=0]
----

TIP: To verify the setup a build should be triggered using `mvn verify`.
The build should succeed and show a console output should containing jQAssistant's scan and analysis messages.

The rules are embedded in Asciidoc documents which are located in the folder `jqassistant/`:

[source,raw]
-----
jqassistant/index.adoc      <1>
jqassistant/module.adoc     <2>
jqassistant/metrics.adoc    <3>
-----
<1> link:jqassistant/index.adoc[index.adoc]: the document used for rendering by Asciidoctor, it contains include directives for both other documents.
<2> link:jqassistant/module.adoc[module.adoc]: reports about the project's module structure as tables, diagrams and GraphML files.
<3> link:jqassistant/metrics.adoc[metrics.adoc]: rules for collecting and reporting metrics as tables and CSV documents.

TIP: The file `index.adoc` is picked up by jQAssistant by default for rendering to HTML.
It must contain at least one rule, usually this is a group declaration.
The rendered HTML documents are located in the folder `target/jqassistant/report/asciidoc`.

== Structural Reports

=== Tables

The file `module.adoc` defines concepts related to the module structure of the project and for generating reports in different representations.

A concept `module:Module` first adds a label `Module` to each child package of the root package `your.project`:

....
include::jqassistant/module.adoc[tags=moduleModule]
....

The returned result defines two columns `Module` (the name of the module) and `Package`.
As no report type is specified for this concept its result is rendered to a table containing these columns:

image::module_table.png[Resultset]

[[component-diagrams]]
=== Component Diagrams
The concept `module:Dependencies` which is based on `module:Module` aggregates the type dependencies to the module packages:

....
include::jqassistant/module.adoc[tags=moduleDependencies]
....

This concept returns the modules (module1, module2) and their dependency relations (dependsOn).
The result is used for generating a component diagram by setting the `reportType` attribute to `plantuml-component-diagram`.

TIP: The generated .plantuml and .svg files are located in the folder `target/jqassistant/report/plantuml`.

[[graphml]]
=== GraphML Files

If diagrams become more complex it may be useful to export them as GraphML documents.
This can be achieved by setting the report type `graphml` as illustrated by the concept `module:DependenciesGraphML`:

....
include::jqassistant/module.adoc[tags=moduleDependenciesGraphML]
....

The HTML document will provide a link to the GraphML file:

image::module_graphml_report_link.png[Resultset]

TIP: The generated .graphml files are located in the folder `target/jqassistant/report/graphml`.
They may be viewed using http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/[yEd].
After opening a file you need to apply a layout, Layout->Hierarchical (Alt-Shift-H).

image::module_graphml_yed.png[]

By extending the result structure the GraphML reports may be used to allow an interactive drill-down from module to type level:

....
include::jqassistant/module.adoc[tags=moduleDependenciesGraphMLDrilldown]
....

This concept returns a graph for each module which is rendered as `parent` containing types (`nodes`) and dependencies (`relationships`) per module.
The generated GraphML report file can be interactively explored in yEd by expanding (`+`) or collapsing (`-`) module nodes and applying the horizontal layout:

image::module_graphml_drilldown_yed.png[]

[[class-diagrams]]
=== Class Diagrams

Java structures returned by a rule may be rendered to class diagrams.
The following elements are supported:

* Packages (`:Java:Package`)
* Types (`:Java:Type`)
* Members (`:Java:Member`, `:Java:Field`, `:Java:Method`)
* Inheritance relations between types (`:EXTENDS`, `:IMPLEMENTS`)
* any other relations between types (rendered as associations)

The concept `module:ClassDiagram` returns all types including their optional fields and methods:

....
include::jqassistant/module.adoc[tags=moduleClassDiagram]
....

As the report type is set to `plantuml-class-diagram` the following diagram is rendered and embedded into the HTML document:

image::module_class_diagram.png[]

[[sequence-diagrams]]
=== Sequence Diagrams

A rule returning a path structure in a column named `sequence` can be rendered to sequence diagrams by setting the report type to `plantuml-sequence-diagram`:

....
include::jqassistant/module.adoc[tags=moduleSequenceDiagram]
....

The nodes of the sequence are interpreted as participants and the relationships between them as messages.
This results in the following diagram to be generated:

image::module_sequence_diagram.png[]

== Metrics

=== Tables

The results of concepts or constraints are rendered to tables by default.
This may be used to directly embed metrics into the HTML documents as illustrated by the concept `metrics:LoCAndComplexity` located in `metrics.adoc`:

....
include::jqassistant/metrics.adoc[tags=metricsTop10LoCAndCC]
....

The HTML document will contain the following table:

image::metrics_table.png[]

[[csv]]
=== CSV Reports

It may be useful to provide metrics as a CSV files for further analysis in other tools.
Fur such cases the report type `csv` may be specified:

....
include::jqassistant/metrics.adoc[tags=metricsLoCTop10LoCAndCCAsCSV]
....

Instead of an embedded table a link to the generated CSV file will be rendered:

image::metrics_csv_link.png[]

TIP: Generated .csv files are located in the folder `target/jqassistant/report/csv`.

The file can now be imported into tools providing support for CSV files:

image::metrics_csv_sheet.png[]

== Rules in XML files

jQAssistant rules may be located in Asciidoc or XML files.
The latter are not rendered to HTML but the results of concepts and constraints can be reported in a similar way as described in the previous sections.
This can be achieved by adding a `<report>` element with a `type` attribute:

[source,xml]
.jqassistant/module.xml
----
include::jqassistant/module.xml[]
----

The generated files will be located in the according sub-directories of `target/jqassistant/report`.
